* Introduction

In traditional relational databases like MySQL, it's natural to model one-to-many relationships using foreign keys and joins. For example, a *Project* has many *Steps*, and retriving a *Project* given a *Step* is as simple as a JOIN Query.

But when migrating to DynamoDB, this approach doesn't translate directly. DynamoDB has no JOINs or foreign keys. Instead, you need to model your data based on access patterns.

This post walks through how to rethink the schema using a single-table design that supports the same functionality with better performance.
